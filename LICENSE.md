## Logo and Trademark

The brand name Alliance Business Suite and it's logos are trademarks of Fenix Alliance S.A.S in Colombia and Fenix Alliance Inc in other countries ("Fenix Alliance").

Fenix Alliance owns and oversees the trademarks for the ABS name and logos. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

- We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the ABS name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve ABS.
- We’d like to make it clear how ABS-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the ABS name and logo.
- We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the ABS name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick, or confuse people who are looking for official ABS resources.

**A note about your account and the privacy of your information.**

The Alliance Passport Services engine is built on top of a highly compliant service to keep your identity private. This engine supports Facebook, Microsoft Accounts, Google+, LinkedIn, and many other identity providers, but you can also integrate your own.

We think that it's also worth pointing out that we DO NOT store any identity information into our databases; instead, that data is always encrypted and sent to the same systems that governments and enterprises worldwide are using to keep your data safe, and then we access that data by using industry-standard protocols so that you can rest assured that your sensitive information is protected through various security controls in addition to multi-factor authentication.
