# Working with Invoices on Accounting Manager.

When a Contact places an order, you can create an invoice to bill them for the upcoming sale. 

## Creating Invoices
Typically, you convert an order into an invoice; however, you can also create an invoice that does not originate from an order. To create an Invoice, you can either navigate to your sales orders, select an existing Order and create an Invoice from it, or you can also create a new invoice that's not related to any order by navigating to Accounting > Billing > Invoices > Create.

### Assigning Invoices to Contacts
As an Accounting Record, Invoices can be related to any Individual/Organization (or both) present on your Contact Sight CRM. To assign an Invoice to a Contact, simply select it from the dropdown list when outlining your new invoice.

**Remarks**: By default, every Individual/Organization on your CRM will be available to be selected as the owner for an Invoice; however, when you select an Individual, the Organizations Dropdown List will be filtered to display only those organizations that are somehow related to the selected Individual. Likewise, if you select an Organization first, the Individuals Dropdown List will be filtered to display only those Individuals that are somehow related to the selected Organization.

### Assigning Invoices to Identities
You can also decide whether or not to relate an identity to your invoices. Identities such as [Account Holders](/Components/Alliance-Passport-Service/Account-Holders.md) or [Business Tenants](/Components/Alliance-Passport-Service/Business-Tenants.md) are users within the Alliance Business Model which can access business applications built with Alliance Business Suite.

When you select an Individual as the Owner for an Invoice, you will be able to select its related Account Holder if you want your invoice to be available through the Studio/API for that particular user. Likewise, when you select an Organization as the owner for your invoice, its related Business Tenant will become available on the Business Dropdown to be selected.
