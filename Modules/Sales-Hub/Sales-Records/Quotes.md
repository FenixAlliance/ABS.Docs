# Managing Quotes:
A Quote, also known as a quotation, is a document issued from a business to a customer outlining the price of a sale before the customer has committed to the purchase.

Using Sales Hub, you can create Quotes taking as a startup point any deal unit present on your system, or by manually outlining a new custom quote. When creating a quotation from a Deal Unit, the new quote will be assigned to the same Deal Unit's related contacts, the Quote amounts will be set to the same values as the Deal Unit, and each Deal Unit Item Record will be copied to the new Quote.
