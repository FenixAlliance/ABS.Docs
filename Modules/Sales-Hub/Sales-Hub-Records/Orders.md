# Managing Orders:
An order is a stated intention, either spoken or written, to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services.

Using Sales Hub, managing orders is not much different from managing Quotes. In fact, Orders can take as a startup point any quotation or deal unit present on the system, or they can be manually outlined.
