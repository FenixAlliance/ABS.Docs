# Carts

Carts are a core part of our application. Carts allow guests, users, and businesses to navigate and customize our offers for their specific needs and preferences through Cart Registrations.

## Overview

Carts define the currency and localization for the entire interface. This means that it will control the display currency for things like offers pricing, CRM, and accounting suite records, and personalize our offers based on your country.

Keep in mind that currency exchange rates are only for display purposes and you will be able to select the base price for every "**Price Input**". This will allow us to make conversions based on current and historical exchange rates, depending on the record type.

## Products in your cart.

Adding products from Infinity Comex to your cart is as easy as clicking a button, but that's not the end of the story. we have designed a simple, yet powerful engine to help you select from a set of available options per product for things like **Shipping**, **warranty, assurance**, **returns** and **refund policies** and more.

## Services in your cart.

When you register a service to your cart, it will be linked to your account through a **Service Cart Registration**. Service cart registrations let you pick from a set of available options like Project Management Methodology, Frontend Stacks, Framework, Programming Language \(Based on the selected Framework\), Operating System, and more.

## Cloud Resources in your cart.

Once you have successfully created your Alliance ID, you will automatically get access to your Tenant Cart. Use it to store products before your checkout process.

# Guest Carts

Guest carts are carts provisioned based on your current IP address. Its lifespan is 24 hours and is aimed to help you navigate your platform even when you are not logged in.

## How is it different from my Guest Cart from my Tenant Cart?

The main difference is that your Tenant Shopping Cart has a slot for your Account ID, while your guest cart contains a slot for your IP address.

Another difference is that guest carts are just for instant navigation for our offerings, but they are actually not suited to place an order through your guest cart.

Also, [Andy](https://fenixalliance.com.co/cognitive/andy), our support bot, is programmed to empty every guest cart on our database ant midnight every two days.

In order to prevent cart deletion, you can log in to your Alliance ID Account to use your Tenant Cart for pre-order adjustments. **Tenant carts have a time span of 31 days.**  

## Guest Cart timespan policy.

**Your guest cart will be deleted every 48 hours**, which means that products on your guest cart might need to be added to your cart again if an old cart has already been deleted. 

# Tenant Carts

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacation right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.

## Registrations Timespan Policy

When you add a product, a service, or a managed cloud resource to your cart, it will create a **Cart Registration**. These registrations will be available for you to customize your order preferences and place orders or provisioning requests with just a click. Cart registrations for your Alliance ID Tenant Cart won't be deleted until the first day of each month. 


# Business Carts

Business Carts get provisioned when you create a business account. They are intended for you to place Product Orders, Service Orders, and Cloud Resource Provisioning Requests.


Please note that access to business services depends on your granted capabilities and you will only be able to access our marketplaces if you are registered as a business owner or administrator, an acquisition manager or an advisor for your currently selected business.


## What is the purpose of Business Carts?

Business' carts are aimed to provide the same functionality as a Tenant or Guest cart, with the difference that every order made from this chart will be processed using it's attached business Tax ID. This allows business owners/administrators and acquisition managers to quickly place orders on behalf of their business,
