# Working with Sales Hub Records on the Alliance Business Suite

Built on top of the powerful Alliance Business Model capabilities for sales, the Alliance Business Suite - Sales Hub Module is being built to cover every stage of your sales process.

## Types of Sales Records
There are three types of sales records across the Alliance Business Model:

### Deal Units:

Deal Units are the first step towards managing your business opportunities since they come to life, to their final state. Deal Units allow you to link several Stock Items from which automatically calculates estimated revenues, profits, taxes, totals, and more.

A Deal unit represents a business opportunity, a deal that you want to start tracking. With a Deal Unit, you can forecast sales revenue, set a potential close date, and factor in the sale's probability.


### Quotes:
A Quote, also known as a quotation, is a document issued from a business to a customer outlining the price of a sale before the customer has committed to the purchase.

Using Sales Hub, you can create Quotes taking as a startup point any deal unit present on your system, or by manually outlining a new custom quote. When creating a quotation from a Deal Unit, the new quote will be assigned to the same Deal Unit's related contacts, the Quote amounts will be set to the same values as the Deal Unit, and each Deal Unit Item Record will be copied to the new Quote.


### Orders:
An order is a stated intention, either spoken or written, to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services.

Using Sales Hub, managing orders is not much different from managing Quotes. In fact, Orders can take as a startup point any quotation or deal unit present on the system, or they can be manually outlined.


# Linking Contacts to Sales Hub Records (Contact-Scoping)
You can link every Sales Record to any specific Individual/Organization (or both) owned by your acting Business Tenant. This enables Contact-Scoped capabilities such as improved analytics, customer segmentation, opportunity discovery, contact billing & more. 


## Linking Identities to Sales Hub Records (Identity-Scoping)
Sales Records can also be bound to a specific Account Holder/Business Tenant (or both). When you select an individual or organization on any Sales Record, Sales Hub will search for Identities related to those contacts. When you relate Identities to Sales Records, those records will become available to those users to see and interact with.

For example, if you assign an Account Holder to an Order, that Account Holder will be able to log in to the platform and find that order onto their billing section (if using Alliance Business Studio), generate an invoice to pay, and pay that Invoice using any of your configured Payment Integrations.


## Understanding Multi-Currency Support for Sales Records 
Sales Hub support's Alliance Business Model's multi-currency specification, meaning that you can manage Sales Records with live & historical multi-currency capabilities.

When adding an amount into Sales Hub, you will be asked to select the currency on which amounts are being provided. This allows Sales Hub to not only present you and your user's information on their favorite currency but also allows your business to manage multi-currency accounting & operations without complications.

## Accounting Manager Interoperability
When you create an order using Sales Hub, you are setting the stage for further Invoice(s) & Payment(s).
The Alliance Business Model links sales & billing entities through a link between any given order and several Invoices. This means you can create & customize a new invoice taking as a startup point any present Order, and further payment for that Invoice can be requested using any of your configured payment integrations.

When creating Invoices from an Order as a Startup Point, Contact Scoping Records, Identity Scoping Records & Order Item Records will be copied to the new Invoice, and the same process takes place when a new payment for any given Invoice is created or received (trough a Payments Gateway Integration).
