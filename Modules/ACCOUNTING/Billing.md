# Managing the Billing Process

The Alliance Business Model contains records to store sales and billing information. Billing records establish a cascading flow designed to suit the business process of any given business around the world.

The Alliance Business Suite | Accounting Module contains several tools built to help customers to harness the power of the Alliance Business Model by adding several Platform API Endpoints and Studio Views to the Alliance Business Suite, enabling customers to:

- Outline Billing Records using Logistics and Sales Data.
- Relate Billing Records to Holders, Accounts, Contacts, and more.
- Expose Billing Records into Web Portals.
- Interoperate with ABS E-Commerce stores.
- Connect several payment gateways.
