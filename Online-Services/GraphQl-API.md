# Welcome to the Alliance Online Services GraphQl API reference documentation.

GraphQL was developed by Facebook to facilitate the consultation of information, for example, a mobile application usually contains less information than a web application, so instead of creating 2 services, a service is created to bring only the information that is needed.

The structure of GraphQL is made up of 3 parts

Operation
Table and/or data
Table fields
GraphQL is based on sending requests through queries, there are 3 types:

Query: To consult the information
Mutation: To modify information (create, delete, modify)
Subscription: For WebSockets (with WebSockets you can for example receive notifications when an event occurs)
