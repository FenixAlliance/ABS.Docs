## Restocking Fees and Return Shipping Labels

Returns are subject to restocking fees and return shipping fees. For products that are eligible for return for replacement, the return shipping labels are free for returns for replacement of the same item within the applicable return policy period. Fenix Alliance S.A.S does NOT charge for restocking fees or return shipping labels for returns of defective products or unopened items that are returned in the original condition as shipped or if you received the wrong product, the product did not match what was shown on the Site or we made some other shipping error, provided the item is returned within its return policy period. In the event a product is returned that is not defective or an incorrect product or where the product does match what was shown on the Site, the product will either be returned to the customer or the return shipping cost initially covered by Fenix Alliance S.A.S will instead be deducted from the refund amount along with any necessary restocking fee that may apply.

## More Information

### Product-Specific Return Information

#### Bundles

Bundles are offered to Fenix Alliance S.A.S shoppers as a way to purchase multiple items together at a discounted price. If you wish to return a Bundle for a refund, you must request a return within the applicable Fenix Alliance S.A.S Return Policy period and you must return the ENTIRE BUNDLE. Items sold as part of a Bundle may be returned individually for replacement if you request a replacement within the applicable Fenix Alliance S.A.S Return Policy period for that individual item.

#### Combos and Kits

Combos and Kits include two or more items that must be purchased together in order to receive a discount. Items sold as part of a Combo or Kit may be returned individually for replacement within the applicable Fenix Alliance S.A.S Return Policy Period for that individual item.

If an individual Combo or Kit item is returned for a refund, the applicable discount will be voided, and the discounted amount will be deducted from the amount of the refund. If your Combo/Kit discount amount is greater than the individual unit price of the item you wish to return, then the item cannot be returned for a refund by itself; you will need to return all items in the Combo/Kit or return it with other items of value in order to receive a refund. For example, if your Combo/Kit discount was $5, and you return one of the items for a refund, the $5 will be deducted from your refund amount.

#### Manufacturer Promotional Items and Fenix Alliance S.A.S Gifts

Manufacturers may offer free promotional items with their products. To receive a full refund on a purchase that includes promotional items, all items must be returned. The cost of any promotional items not returned will be deducted from the refund total.

Fenix Alliance S.A.S may also offer gifts to valued customers for their continued support as well as for special giveaways. These gifts are not part of any purchase value and therefore do not have to be returned.

Purchases for prepaid cards, gift packaging and memberships are not eligible for return.

## Special Order Products

Special order products are not eligible for return.

Quantity Purchases

While we are more than happy to fill your order for a quantity of ten (10 +) or more of any given item in our inventory on a single purchase order, please understand that an order of that size, once purchase is completed, is automatically non-refundable.

## Additional Return Information

For returns for refunds for items purchased as discounts, Fenix Alliance S.A.S will issue you a refund in the form of Alliance ID Wallet credit or an Infinity Comex gift card.

### Replacements

For products that are eligible for return for replacement, the product may only be returned for a replacement of the same item.

###Product Return Procedures

To return a product to Fenix Alliance S.A.S, you must obtain an RMA number within the applicable return period for the product (described above). Fenix Alliance S.A.S will not accept returns without prior authorization and an RMA number.

Customer should prominently display the RMA number(s) on the shipping label as well as the RMA invoice on the box(s) containing the returned product.

Customer is solely responsible for shipping any returned product to Fenix Alliance S.A.S. Customer agrees to use only reputable carriers capable of providing proof of delivery and insurance for the entire value of the shipment. Customer agrees to bear all shipping and insurance charges and all risk of loss for the return product during shipment. Customer agrees that all returned products will be 100% complete, in re-sealable condition, and will include the original packaging material, manuals, blank warranty cards, and other accessories provided by the manufacturer. If any component of the returned product is missing, Fenix Alliance S.A.S's Return Procedure will be breached and Fenix Alliance S.A.S may in its sole and absolute discretion reject the entire return or choose to impose additional charges against the customer for replacement of the missing component(s). Fenix Alliance S.A.S will not refund the original shipping charges to the Customer. In addition, Fenix Alliance S.A.S may assess a 15% restocking fee against the Customer's account or deduct the fee from the refund amount on all returns, subject to the Return Policy and any product-specific policy. Fenix Alliance S.A.S reserves the right to adjust the value of any item returned for refund to reflect its current market price, in which case the 15% restocking fee will be applied after this adjustment.

### Packaging Returns

The return must be properly packaged to protect against damage in transit. Please note that any damage caused by mishandling, improper installation or product defacement will result in your return being denied and the product being returned to you.

### Return Processing

Please allow 3-5 business days for your return to process after being received. For returns for laptops, notebooks, desktops, or table PCs, please allow 7-10 business days for your return to process after being received. Due to item availability, some repair/replacement returns may be delayed or changed to refund.
