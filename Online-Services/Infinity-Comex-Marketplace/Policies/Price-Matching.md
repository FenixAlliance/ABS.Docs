# Price matching Policy

With the exception of items that are currently part for our Price Match Guarantee promotion, Fenix Alliance S.A.S does not offer price guarantees.

With the exception of items that are currently part for our **Price Match Guarantee** promotion, Fenix Alliance S.A.S does not offer price guarantees due to the fact that industry prices change quickly and often. All prices are as posted at the time of purchase. If your order has not been shipped, you can choose to cancel it and re-order to take advantage of any new prices.

## Price Match Guarantee

If you find an item advertised at a lower price by an eligible retailer for a product that has a Price Match Guarantee badge on its page, within 5 days of purchase, we will match it after verification

Items with the Price Match Guarantee come with a one-time price match guarantee. If you purchase an item from Fenix Alliance S.A.S which is carrying the Price Match Guarantee badge at the time of purchase, then find the exact same item at a lower price by Fenix Alliance or a major retailer,* within 5 calendar days, just [let us know](https://fenix-alliance.com/support), and we'll send you an Infinity Comex Customer Care Card to cover the difference.
