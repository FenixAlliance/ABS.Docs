# Getting Started with the Alliance Business Suite

Data is at the center of every modern business, unlocking new paths and ideas for operational performance and customer experience, but gathering and analyzing data is rather a complicated, time-consuming task. In an increasingly globalized world, technology is a key differentiator between those who stay ahead and those who don't. 

To help businesses across the world to harness this promise, we've created a digital solution aimed to give organizations the ability to cover their main operations without constraining our customers with opinionated business development platforms.

The Alliance Business Suite lets you build outstanding and secure web and mobile apps. This is what you need to get started:

1. Buy a license (or get a community license for free), or sign up for a free 30-day trial license. 
1. Install the Alliance Business Suite.
1. Start building.

## About licensing

Our Community Edition was released to help you make your life easier while increasing your odds for success through the right tools and support required for your path for digitalization.

The Community Edition License is not a demo license. You’ll get access to the entire ABS. Either if you are an individual or an organization.

In a nutshell, You’ll only pay for core licensing fees if you use the ABS on behalf of an Enterprise, who’s an organization and its affiliates who collectively have either (a) more than 250 PCs or users or (b) more than one million U.S. dollars (or the equivalent in other currencies) in annual revenues.
