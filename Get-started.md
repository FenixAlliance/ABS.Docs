# Getting Started with the Alliance Business Suite

Data is at the center of every modern business, unlocking new paths and ideas for operational performance and customer experience, but gathering and analyzing data is rather a complicated, time-consuming task. In an increasingly globalized world, technology is a key differentiator between those who stay ahead and those who don't. 

To help businesses across the world to harness this promise, we've created a digital solution aimed to give organizations the ability to cover their main operations without constraining our customers with opinionated business development platforms.

The Alliance Business Suite lets you build outstanding and secure web and mobile apps. This is what you need to get started:

1. Buy a license (or sign up for a free 30-day trial license), or get a community license for free. 
1. [Install the Alliance Business Suite](/Fundamentals/Installation.md).
1. Start building your business.
