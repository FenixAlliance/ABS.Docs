# View models on hubs (BIM 360 or Fusion Team)

# Description

This sample shows a basic tree view with Hubs, Projects, Folders, and Items. It does not use the ASP.NET native [TreeView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.treeview.aspx) due to its limitations, but the [jsTree](https://www.jstree.com/) library, that has support for menus, reload, among other features. This sample is based on the [Learn Forge](http://learnforge.autodesk.io) tutorial.

The tree view will display personal enterprise (shared) hubs, with respective projects. For Civil 3D drawings with Alignments, the **Alignment Design Check** toolbar icon list alignments and compare its curves with a minimum radius value. The following image demonstrates a typical tree view:

### Troubleshooting

1. ** Can't see my BIM 360 projects**: Make sure to provision the Forge App Client ID within the BIM 360 Account, [learn more here](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps). This requires the Account Admin permission.

2. **error setting certificate verify locations** error: may happen on Windows, use the following: 
>`git config --global http.sslverify "false"`
