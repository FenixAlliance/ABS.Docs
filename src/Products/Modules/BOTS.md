# Getting Started with the ABS Bot Composer

[[_TOC_]]


ABS Bot Composer empowers teams to easily create powerful bots using a guided, no-code graphical interface without the need for data scientists or developers. ABS Bot Composer addresses many of the major issues with bot-building in the industry today. It eliminates the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams building the bots, and the long latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to address it. It removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and the need to write complex code. And, it minimizes the IT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution.

Using ABS Bot Composer, you can:

1. Empower your teams by allowing them to easily build bots themselves without needing intermediaries, or coding or AI expertise.
1. Reduce costs by easily automating common inquiries and freeing human agent time to deal with more complex issues.
1. Improve customer satisfaction by allowing customers to self-help and resolve issues quickly 24/7 using rich personalized bot conversations.

Highlights of ABS Bot Composer 
Get started in seconds. ABS Bot Composer is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering. It allows you to easily sign up, create your bot, and embed it into your website with just a few clicks. There’s no infrastructure to maintain or complex systems to deploy.

Empower your subject matter experts. Using ABS Bot Composer, you are in the driver's seat. Your SMEs can create bots quickly and easily using a novel, intuitive, code-free graphical interface, eliminating the need for AI expertise or teams of developers.

## No-code interface

Enable rich, natural conversations. Built on top of Azure, the Microsoft Bot Framework and Microsoft’s powerful conversational AI capabilities, the ABS Bot Composer can help you enable your end-users to have rich multi-turn conversations that quickly guide them to the right solution. And, unlike most products on the market, there’s no need to retrain AI models. Simply provide a few short examples of the topic you want the bot to handle, build the conversation using our graphical editor and your bot is ready to handle customer requests about it. You can even try out your changes in real-time in the test pane!

## Natural conversation with a bot

Enable bots to take action. Bots that can chat with your users are great, but bots that can act on their behalf are even better. With ABS Bot Composer, you can easily integrate with services and back-end systems out-of-the-box or through hundreds of easy-to-add custom connectors using custom workflows. This makes it simple to create a bot that not only responds to the user but also takes action on their behalf.

## Bot actions

Monitor and improve bot performance. ABS Bot Composer lets you keep an eye on how your bots are performing using powerful metrics and AI-driven dashboards. Easily see which topics are doing well and where the bot can improve, and quickly make adjustments to improve performance.

## Analytics page

Better together. ABS Bot Composer works hand-in-hand with other Alliance Business Suite Modules to provide a holistic view of your customer service operations. You can use Customer Hub, Analytic Insights and Bot Composer together to determine which topics are trending or consuming support resources, and then easily automate them.
