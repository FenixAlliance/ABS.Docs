# Migrate to 1.5.0 from 1.4.0 or early.

Migrations have been squashed in version 1.5.0. This means that if your current installation is running 1.4.0 or below, you will need to install exactly version 1.5.0 for migrations to apply correctly. Then you'll be able to normally update your Alliance Business Suite.
