# WOPI Integration

The ABS Workplace module is built on top of the Web Application Open Platform Interface (WOPI) protocol to integrate Office for the web with a storage container. The WOPI protocol enables Office for the web to access and change files that are stored in the [Alliance Business Platform](/English/Products/Alliance-Business-Platform).

About the WOPI protocol - The Alliance Business Platform REST API contains an implementation of a set of REST endpoints that expose information about the documents stored in your storage containers to allow you to view or edit in Office for the web. The set of WOPI operations that are supported are described in the section titled [Workplace Module API](https://fenixalliance.com.co/api/v2/documentation/index.html?urls.primaryName=Workplace%20Module%20API) for the [ABP REST API V2](https://fenixalliance.com.co/api/v2/documentation).
