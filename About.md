# About this Documentation

Welcome to the Alliance Business Suite documentation! We are on the mission to create the Ultimate Business Development Platform to provide you an unprecedented suite of capabilities to ensure your business can exceed customer's expectations through next-generation experiences. 

We believe that knowing your customers and your business enables you to personalize each experience and optimizes efficiencies so you can earn customers for life.

This documentation is constantly being developed and adapted to the latest version of the Alliance Business Suite and its goal is to provide an extensive guide for technical and non-technical audiences alike. At a very high level, this documentation provides guides on how to perform common tasks within the Alliance Business Suite, but it also digs deeper, sometimes, into technical details; but don't worry, we'll let you know the technical difficulty at the beginning of every guide.

Some guides contained in this documentation require special [Business Permissions](/Components/Alliance-Passport-Service/Business-Permissions.md) or installable software. Requirements, if any, will be highlighted at the beginning of each guide.

Some parts of this documentation are still being developed and changes are made to it every day, so please feel free to request further explanation or provide feedback about features you would like us to explain in more detail.
