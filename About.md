# Introduction

Welcome to the Alliance Business Suite! We are delighted to offer you a suite of capabilities to ensure your business can exceed customer's expectations through next-generation experiences. We believe that knowing your customers and your business enables you to personalize each experience and optimizes your agents' productivity so you can earn customers for life.

The problem raised when we were trying to onboard our own business. There are a ton of solutions out there to help businesses manage their business, but they are often expensive, complex, and decentralized; and worst yet, their extensibility capabilities are close to non-existent.

We decided to create our own platform, knowing this could potentially cost way too much more than just paying for an existent solution, but we had something else in mind. We started to build an enterprise LOB solution to help our business to address several key aspects of our global day-to-day operations.

Built on top of the Alliance Business Platform, the Alliance Business Suite provides customers with a simple, easy-to-use suite of modern business applications built to help you achieve operational excellence through extensibility and automation, driving improvements in data integrity and enabling faster, better decision making, and more effective actions.
