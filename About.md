# About this Documentation

Welcome to the Alliance Business Suite documentation! We are on the mission to create the Ultimate Business Development Platform to provide you an unprecedented suite of capabilities to ensure your business can exceed customer's expectations through next-generation experiences. 

We believe that knowing your customers and your business enables you to personalize each experience and optimizes efficiencies so you can earn customers for life.

This documentation is constantly being developed and adapted to the latest version of the Alliance Business Suite and its goal is to provide an extensive guide for technical and non-technical audiences alike. At a very high level, this documentation provides guides on how to perform common tasks within the Alliance Business Suite, but it also digs deeper, sometimes, into technical details; but don't worry, we'll let you know the technical difficulty at the beginning of every guide.

Some guides contained in this documentation require special [Business Permissions](/Components/Alliance-Passport-Service/Business-Permissions.md) or installable software. Requirements, if any, will be highlighted at the beginning of each guide.

Some parts of this documentation are still being developed and changes are made to it every day, so please feel free to request further explanation or provide feedback about features you would like us to explain in more detail.

# Contributing to the Alliance Business Suite and/or its documentation

Woohoo! You've decided to contribute? That's amazing! We want to make contributions to the Alliance Business Suite as easy and frictionless as we can. Contributing requires a GitHub account. If you don't have an account, follow the instructions for the [GitHub account setup](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account). 

Then, you just need to [create an Issue](https://github.com/FenixAlliance/ABS.Docs/issues/new/choose) to report bugs, propose APIs, request features and tooling, propose designs and improvements.

All of these contributions will be filled as Issues on the [Alliance Business Suite Documentation Repository](https://github.com/FenixAlliance/ABS.Docs) and they adhere to the following Issue Management Policy.


# Issue Management Policy

Because we want to create a world-class product, we spend most of our time coding, designing, and architecting a well-designed solution, so we have adopted the .NET's Issue Management Policy to help us manage incoming Issues. This is a brief summary of some of the policies we have in place and the justification for them.

Commenting on closed issues
In general, we recommend you open a new issue if you have a bug, feature request, or question to discuss. If you find a closed issue that is related, open a new issue and link to the closed issue rather than posting on the closed issue. Closed issues don't appear in our triage process, so only the people who have been active on the original thread will be notified of your comment. A new issue will get more attention from the team.

In general, we don't mind getting duplicate issues. It's easier for us to close duplicate issues than to discuss multiple root causes on a single issue! We may close your issue as a duplicate if we determine it has the same root cause as another. Don't worry! It's not a waste of our time!

## Needs Author Feedback
If a contributor reviews an issue and determines that more information is needed from the author, they will post a comment requesting that information and apply the Needs: Author Feedback label. This label indicates that the author needs to post a response in order for us to continue investigating the issue.

If the author does not post a response within 7 days, the issue will be automatically closed. If the author responds within 7 days after the issue is closed, the issue will be automatically re-opened. We recognize that you may not be able to respond immediately to our requests, we're happy to hear from you whenever you're able to provide the new information.

## PR: pending author input
Similar to the Needs Author Feedback process above, PRs also require author input from time to time. When a member of our team asks for some follow-up changes from the author, we mark these PRs with pr: pending author input label. After doing so, we expect the author to respond within 14 days. If the author does not post a response or updates the PR within 14 days, the issue will be automatically closed. If the author responds within 7 days after the issue is closed, the issue will be automatically re-opened. We recognize that you may not be able to respond immediately to our requests, we're happy to hear from you whenever you're able to provide the new information.

## Duplicate issues
If we determine that the issue is a duplicate of another, we will label it with the Resolution: Duplicate label. The issue will be automatically closed in 1 day of inactivity.

## Answered questions
If we determine that the issue is a question and have posted an answer, we will label it with the Resolution: Answered label. The issue will be automatically closed in 1 day of inactivity.

## Locking closed issues
After an issue has been closed and had no activity for 30 days it will be automatically locked as resolved. This is done in order to reduce confusion as to where to post new comments. If you are still encountering the problem reported in an issue, or have a related question or bug report, feel free to open a new issue and link to the original (now locked) issue!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately to Fenix Alliance either by emailing support@fenix-alliance.com or via the portal at https://fenix-alliance.com.
