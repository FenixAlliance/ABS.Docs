The Alliance Business Cloud is designed to help IT specialists manage Alliance Business Suite instances and their required services such as web, DNS, mail, and other services through a comprehensive and user-friendly GUI called the **[ABC Portal](https://cloud.absuite.net)**. The ABC Portal is a hosting control panel built on top of [Plesk](https://plesk.com/), an intermediary between system services and ABS instances. For example, when a user creates a website through the ABC Portal GUI, Plesk propagates this request to a web server running IIS, and the latter adds a new virtual host to the system. This method of administering all system services from a single web interface reduces maintenance costs and gives administrators more flexibility and control.

## How can I use the ABC Portal?

The ABC Portal is an essential instrument for customers, businesses, Alliance Trusted Advisors. Once an instance is provisioned on a server, the ABC Portal enables customers to organize and quickly provision resources and monitor consumption. The customers are companies and individuals who need a strong suite of LOB applications to support their operations in a digital society but do not have the necessary IT infrastructure.
