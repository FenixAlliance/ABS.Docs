## How to get started?

The Alliance Business Suite enables developers and non-developers alike to easily configure and manage security. The Alliance Passport Services Library contains features for managing authentication, authorization, data protection, HTTPS enforcement, app secrets, XSRF/CSRF prevention, and CORS management. These security features allow you to build robust yet secure Alliance Business Suite apps.

## Alliance Business Suite security features

The Alliance Business Suite provides many tools and libraries to secure your apps including built-in identity providers, but you can use third-party identity services such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. With the Alliance Business Suite, you can easily manage app secrets, which are a way to store and use confidential information without having to expose it in the code.

## Authentication vs. Authorization
Authentication is a process in which a user provides credentials that are then compared to those stored in an operating system, database, app, or resource. If they match, users authenticate successfully, and can then perform actions that they're authorized for, during an authorization process. The authorization refers to the process that determines what a user is allowed to do.

Another way to think of authentication is to consider it as a way to enter a space, such as a server, database, app, or resource, while authorization is which actions the user can perform to which objects inside that space (server, database, or app).

## Common Vulnerabilities in software
The Alliance Business Suite contains features that help you secure your apps and prevent security breaches. The following list briefly exposes the techniques used to avoid the most common security vulnerabilities in web apps:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- SQL injection attacks
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks
- Open redirect attacks

There are more vulnerabilities that you should be aware of. For more information, see the other articles in the Security and Identity section of the table of contents.
