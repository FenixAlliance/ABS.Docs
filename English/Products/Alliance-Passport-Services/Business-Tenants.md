# Business Tenant Accounts

Once a user has an Alliance ID account, they will be able to create one or more Business Tenants. There is currently a creation limit of 5 Business Tenants per Alliance ID Holder.

An Alliance ID Holder can request the Alliance support service to raise the tenant quota given the need.

Once your form has been correctly filled, your business' information will be submitted for review, but your business tenant account will be created successfully and your Alliance ID Holder will be added as the root account for that business.


You have now successfully created a business tenant account and only your current Alliance ID Account will be able to select it as root.
