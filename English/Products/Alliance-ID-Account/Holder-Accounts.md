# Create your Account Holder
## Creating your Alliance ID through an identity provider: \(e.g. Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google...\)
------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------
If you donâ€™t already have an Alliance ID account, you can get it for free by using those accounts that you already own and use \(like your social media accounts\). For this matter, you will need to select the identity provider of your choice when you [create your Alliance ID](https://fenixalliance.com.co/Account/SignIn). 


You will need to login to your Alliance ID account through tour chosen identity provider to get access to your account and resources.

## Creating your Alliance ID through a local account.
------------------------------ ----------------------
We want to give you options. If you don't want to use or you don't have any social media account, you can go old style and create your Alliance ID Account through your Email address. This will mean for you that you will need to verify that email address through a code. This will also enable a password for your account, so you will need to provide a strong password to continue with your sign up process.

## The IAM module contains all the access logic to the Alliance ID account, It is composed of roles capable of assuming a certain set of permissions to act on behalf of a Business Tenant.
