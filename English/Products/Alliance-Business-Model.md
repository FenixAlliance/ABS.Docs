# Alliance Business Model (ABM) Schema
---

The Alliance Business Model is a declarative specification and definition of standard entities representing commonly used concepts and activities across business and productivity applications and is being extended to observational and analytical data. 


The Alliance Business Model provides well-defined, modular, and extensible business entities such as Account, Deal Unit, Case, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and Items, as well as interactions with vendors, workers, and customers, such as activities and service level agreements. 
In a nutshell, the Alliance Business Model serves as the main dynamic data layer for the entire Alliance Business Suite.

We're currently working to let anyone extend the Alliance Business Model definitions to capture additional business-specific scenarios.
