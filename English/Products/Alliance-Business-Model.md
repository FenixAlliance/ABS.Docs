The Alliance Business Model is a declarative specification and definition of standard entities that represent commonly used concepts and activities across business and productivity applications and is being extended to observational and analytical data as well. ABM provides well-defined, modular, and extensible business entities such as Account, Business Unit, Case, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and Items (Products/Services), as well as interactions with vendors, workers, and customers, such as activities and service level agreements. that serve as the dynamic data layer for the entire Alliance Business Suite.

Anyone can build on and extend ABM definitions to capture additional business-specific scenarios.
