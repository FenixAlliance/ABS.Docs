With ABS Portals, users can create external-facing websites that allow employees, customers, partners, and others outside their organizations to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in the Alliance Business Model, or browse content anonymously. 

These capabilities feature a revamped end-to-end experience for makers to quickly create a website and customize it with pages, layout, and content. Developers can reuse page designs through templates, add forms and views to display key data from the Alliance Business Model, and publish it to users.
