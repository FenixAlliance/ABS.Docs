The Alliance Business Suite contains a simple, yet powerful engine for enabling seamless Single Page Application development using Angular, React, or React+Redux.

The SPA Service provides a convenient template to act as a starting point for Client-Side Applications using Angular and the Angular CLI to implement a rich, client-side user interface (UI) while still taking advantage of the tremendous power of the Alliance Business Suite without the hustle of creating and connecting an independent application.


There are slight differences between the Angular app created for the Alliance Business Suite and the one created by Angular CLI itself (via ng new); however, the app's capabilities are unchanged. The app created by the template contains a Bootstrap-based layout and a basic routing example.


The template is equivalent to creating an ASP.NET Core project to act as an API backend and an Angular CLI project to act as a UI. The template offers the convenience of hosting both project types in a single app project. Consequently, the app project can be built and published as a single unit.


# Creating a SPA Application

To create a new Client-Side application for the Alliance Business Suite, head over to your ABS Studio, click on integrations from the top right-hand side corner of your state bar. Select Alliance Business Suite > Applications > Create Application.

There, fill out the form, select a name for your application and mark your new application as a Single Page Application. There, you will be prompted with additional required properties for your application.


You can customize things like:

- The NPM Publish Script
- The NPM Start Script
- The SPA Engine (Select Angular)

# Updating your React Application

The template is equivalent to creating both an ASP.NET Core project to act as an API backend, and a standard CRA React project to act as a UI, but with the convenience of hosting both in a single app project that can be built and published as a single unit.

The React project template isn't meant for server-side rendering (SSR). For SSR with React and Node.js, consider Next.js or Razzle.
