### What are cookies?

A cookie is a small file that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system or your mobile device. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Fenix Alliance) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".Third-party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, videos and website analytics services). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

### How long do cookies last?

Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your website browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed and can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you later re-open your browser and browse the internet again.

### How do We use cookies?

We use first-party cookies to allow us to understand what areas of the Site are of interest to you so we can better serve and provide you with tailored information from the Site. We use first-party cookies to collect data such as information about your web browser and operating system, the frequency of your visits, what you do on the Site and if you arrived at the Site from another website, the URL of that website. Our third party web analytics provider then collects and analyses the data We obtain from Our cookies to tell us how you use the Site. Please see the table below for details of the third parties that we work within this context.

Fenix Alliance may also use first-party cookies when you register for some parts of the Site such as Our web programs or extranets. In this case, a cookie will store useful information, including your personal information, which enables the Site to remember you when you return to visit. Only We can read the information We gather from the cookies we place on your system.

We also, through third-party vendors, use remarketing techniques on the Site. When you visit the Site remarketing allows Our third party vendors to show you adverts for our products that you browsed for on the Site when you visit other websites on the Internet. To do this Our third-party vendors use cookies that they place on the Site (third party cookies) to identify the products and topics on the Site that you have browsed for. They then use the information obtained from these cookies to serve you with adverts relevant to these products and topics when you visit other websites on the Internet. Information about your use of the Site which is used for remarketing is deleted after 30 days.

### Other technologies We may use

The Site may also use “Web beacon” technologies. When you access pages on with a Web beacon, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our analytics vendors. These Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of the Site are of interest to Our visitors, how many of Our newsletters have been read and to help us provide you with tailored information from the Site. If you choose not to accept cookies, Web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other information and are disregarded.

We also use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as “Flash cookies”, on the Site. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on the Site. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access personal information that you have provided on this site, and cannot be accessed by other websites. To find out more about Flash cookies or how to disable them, please click here: [http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html).

We will collect your IP address when you visit the Site. From this, we may be able to identify the approximate geographic location of the computer from which you are visiting the Site and the domain that it is using to access the Internet. If you are visiting the Site from a company location, we will use this information to identify the company from which you are visiting and to pre-populate the web-forms that you use on the Site with information about your company and the country from which you are visiting the Site.

Finally, we also use third-party advertising companies for banner placements who in turn use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner. These files enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to the Site. The cookie is placed by Us and Our ad management partner who works with advertising solutions companies (including DoubleClick). With both cookies and Spotlight technology (the tool used to determine the effectiveness of online advertising), the information that We collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address, for example. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt-out of these technologies, go to [http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/).
