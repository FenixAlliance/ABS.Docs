# Documentation Overview

## What we want to leverage with our applications.

We want to give you the power to harness your entire potential through technology, without having to worry about any of the complexity and technical aspects. We simply want to help you make your life easier while increasing your odds for success through the right tools and support on the path for digitalization.

 For us, it is all about productivity and how to help you push forward your vision through technology. To reach beyond expectations together. 

## Where we are on the stage?

We are creating our applications in such a form that they deliver as much value to your business and cause as we can. They work primarily as an interface for users to manage their **services**, **products**, and **cloud resources**. But the truth is that it isn't limited to just that. 

Our applications are being developed to give you access to every functionality that we implement for our business, to power your business and vision as well. This is because if we can add value to our business and gain a competitive advantage through these tools, chances are you can too!

## How to get started?

To get started, you will need to create an Alliance ID account. Now, you may think... ðŸ™„ another account? But don't worry. Creating your Alliance ID Account is \(and will always be\) free, takes just a few seconds and you don't even need a password \(unless you want to have one\). This account will give you instant access to everything else at Fenix Alliance Group.

## A note about your account and the privacy of your information.

The Alliance ID Accounts engine is built on top of a highly compliant service to keep your identity private. This engine supports Facebook, Microsoft Accounts, Google+, LinkedIn, and many other identity providers, or you can talk to our technical team to integrate your own.

We think that it's also worth pointing out that we DO NOT store any identity information into our databases; instead, that data is always encrypted and sent to the same systems that governments and enterprises worldwide are using to keep your data safe, and then we access that data by using industry-standard protocols so that you can rest assured that your sensitive information is protected through various security controls in addition to multi-factor authentication.
