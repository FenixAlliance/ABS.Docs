# OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols on the Alliance Passport Platform

The Alliance Passport Service endpoint for identity-as-a-service implements authentication and authorization with the industry-standard protocols OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0, respectively. While the service is standards-compliant, there can be subtle differences between any two implementations of these protocols. The information here will be useful if you choose to write your code by directly sending and handling HTTP requests or using a third-party open-source library, rather than using one of our open-source libraries.
