# Working with Business Permissions

After your request has been authenticated and authorized, the Alliance Passport Service approves the actions or operations in your request. Operations are defined by service and include things that you can do to a resource, such as reading, creating, editing, and deleting that resource. For example, APS supports several actions for each [ABM Record](/Components/Alliance-Business-Model/Records.md), including the following actions:

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete


To allow an **Identity** to perform an operation, you must include the necessary actions in a role and then assign to the Identity the Role that grants action access to the affected resource type. 

# Granting Business Permissions

Business Permissions can be assigned to any APS Identity either as a single permission or through a role that contains the specified permission.

Business Permissions can be granted through the [Alliance Business Studio](/Components/Alliance-Business-Studio.md) on the Network Manager section.
