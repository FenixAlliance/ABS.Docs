# Understanding the Alliance Core Libraries.

The Alliance Core Libraries contains the core abstractions and default implementations required by the Alliance Business Model and dependent components. It is also the external dependency source for the entire Alliance Business Suite, which means that external dependencies, which are dependencies outside the FenixAlliance.* namespace are referred to by the `FenixAlliance.ACL.Deps` Package, which is the base ACL Package and, therefore, it could be referred to as the Core Package.

For more information on the dependency tree, design overview, and external dependencies, please refer to Advanced Topics.
