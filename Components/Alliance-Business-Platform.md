---

The Alliance Business Platform is a Modular Application Framework built on .NET with the best of REST, SignalR, GraphQl y gRPC capabilities and it's built on top of the the [Alliance Business Model](/Components/Alliance-Business-Model.md) Schema (ABM). 

The Alliance Business Platform is also a Mobile Backend framework for integrating next-generation functionalities into your mobile applications. 

It allows you to build spectacular single-page apps using .NET and C# with or without JavaScript. ABP apps can connect and transact to the data layer (The Alliance Business Modal Schema) using any language through standard requests through the various GrPC, HTTP, and GraphQL Endpoints. 

The **Alliance Business Platform** provides a unified programmability model that you can use to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with the data on the Alliance Business Model.
