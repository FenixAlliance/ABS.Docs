# Alliance Business Model (ABM) Schema
---

In a nutshell, the Alliance Business Model serves as the main dynamic data layer for the entire Alliance Business Suite.

The Alliance Business Model is a declarative schema definition of standard entities representing commonly used concepts and activities across business and productivity applications, and is being extended to observational and analytical data. 

The Alliance Business Model provides well-defined, modular, and extensible business entities such as Account, Deal Unit, Case, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and Product, as well as interactions with suppliers, employees, and customers, such as activities and service level agreements. 



# Configurations

# Providers

# Extensions

We're currently working to let anyone extend the Alliance Business Model definitions to capture additional business-specific scenarios.

# Entities

Use the [Alliance Business Suite's API reference](https://docs.absuite.net/reference/html/) to explore and learn about all the available [Alliance Business Model entity definitions](https://docs.absuite.net/reference/html/d6/d73/namespace_fenix_alliance_1_1_a_b_m_1_1_models.html), their attributes, and purposes. These entities span several business domains and describe data in different applications and solutions. For example, you can find entity definitions related to Accounting, Learning, Human Resources and more.

We also maintain a Visual Reference Diagram on GitHub to allow customers to easily identify entities on the Alliance Business Model.
