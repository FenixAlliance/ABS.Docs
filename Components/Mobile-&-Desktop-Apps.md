# Use the Alliance Business Suite as a Mobile Backend (Experimental)

Alliance Business Suite Mobile Apps is a set of client and server libraries aimed to create mobile/desktop applications that integrate to the Alliance Business Suite using Blazor on .NET MAUI.

Currently, we support:

- .NET + Blazor on the server-side (for security)
- .NET MAUI + Blazor Client-side (Access to Native APIs)
