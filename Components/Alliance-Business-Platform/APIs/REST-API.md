# Welcome to the Alliance Business Platform REST API reference for the v2.0 endpoint.

[[_TOC_]]

API sets on the <a href="https://fenixalliance.com.co/api/v2/documentation/index.html" target="_blank">ABS v2.0 endpoint</a>
 are in general availability \(GA\) status, and have gone through a review-and-feedback process with customers to meet practical, production needs. Updates to APIs on this endpoint are additive in nature and do not break existing app scenarios.



Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are service endpoints that support sets of HTTP operations (methods), which provide create, retrieve, update, or delete access to the service's resources. This section will give you an overall overview of processes like:

- How to call ABP REST APIs with Postman, CURL and the Powershell SDK.
- Common use cases for the ABP REST API.
- The basic components of a REST API request/response pair.
- How to register your client application with ABP Identity and access management (IAM) to secure your REST requests.
- Overviews of creating and sending a REST request, and handling the response.
- Additional resources about versioning and support contact information.

## How to call the ABP REST APIs with Postman
The following video will show you how to quickly authenticate with the [ABP REST API Authentication Endpoints](https://fenixalliance.com.co/api/v2/documentation) via the client id/secret method. We encourage you to continue reading below to learn about what constitutes a REST operation, but if you need to quickly call the APIs, this video is for you.
