# Working with the Wallets Service on the Alliance Business Suite

Wallets across the Alliance Business Suite are designed to serve several purposes depending on the server's configuration.

At a high level, Wallets are accounts are related to an Account Holder or a Contact Record. These accounts are then used to create a unified network where transactions are possible in any direction within these three types of records.

Wallet Accounts serve the purpose of storing and transacting value across said networks, enabling customers to easily create commercial and financial services ready to grow and scale.

Wallet accounts are also related to an Accounting Account, which is a group of accounting records used to produce Accounting and Financial Reports.

## Transactions across Wallets

Transactions across Wallets serve the purpose of transferring value amounts across the network. On each transaction, there are at least two Wallet Accounts involved. A transaction starts with a Wallet Owner (either an Account Holder, a Business Tenant, or a Contact Record) defining an amount and a destination account registered to their wallet.

Upon proper Waller Decryption (which might require re-authentication), the transaction will be processed and signed by the Alliance Business Platform using dynamically generated signing keys.

## Understanding Contact Wallets

Contact Wallets are Regular Wallet Accounts that instead of being related to an AccountHolder or a Business Tenant, are related to a Contact Record on the CRM Section of the Alliance Business Model.

This might seem odd, given that to either a B2B or a B2C Scenario, only two types of wallets are required: A Business-Related Wallet and a Customer-Related Wallet. So, what's the purpose of Contact Wallets?
