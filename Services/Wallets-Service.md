# Working with the Wallets Service on the Alliance Business Suite

Wallets across the Alliance Business Suite are designed to serve several purposes depending on the server's configuration.

At a high level, Wallets are accounts are related to an Account Holder or a Contact Record. These accounts are then used to create a unified network where transactions are possible in any direction within these three types of records.

Wallet Accounts serve the purpose of storing and transacting value across said networks, enabling customers to easily create commercial and financial services ready to grow and scale.

Wallet accounts are also related to an Accounting Account, which is a group of accounting records used to produce Accounting and Financial Reports.
