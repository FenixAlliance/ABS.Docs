Welcome to the Alliance Business Suite!

The Alliance Business Suite is a set of intelligent, extensible, multi-tenant business applications that enable users to jumpstart your business through the acceleration of several core aspects of any given business.

The Alliance Business Suite gives users a Full-Stack, Modular Application Framework built on top of the [Alliance Business Platform](https://absuite.net). 

Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing users to extend the product with their own code through Module libraries. It builds upon next-generation technologies such as Blazor, SignalR, Razor Pages, and MVC through ASP.NET Core, an open-source and cross-platform web UI framework for building web apps using .NET and C# with or without the use of JavaScript.

ABS Apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. 

## About the Alliance Business Creed

We're designed to succeed when you and your business succeed; that's why we're commited to help as much people as possible to harness their entire potential. By building on top of word-class technologies, we're designing this solution to jumpstart your business without having to worry about any of the complexity and technical aspects. We simply want to help you make your life easier while increasing your odds for success through the right tools and support on the path to digitalization.

The fact is, since our inception, we've steered towards creating culture designed to reach beyond expectations together by building an organization whos success strategy is to help others to succeed.

### Well when. What do I get?
We are creating our applications in such a form that they deliver as much value to your business and cause as we can. They work primarily as an interface for users to manage their services, products, and cloud resources. But the truth is that isn't limited to just that.

Our applications are being developed to give you access to every functionality that we implement for our business, to power your business and vision as well. This is because if we can add value to our business and gain a competitive advantage through these tools, chances are you can too!

So far, we've created a few extensions and connectors for the Alliance Business Suite, but you can extend it too! Some of these extensions are open source, so feel free to chech their code for extension reference.

Connectors are always free and you can find them in your ABS Extensions page, and some of our extensions have free tiers. You will get the Alliance Business Suite Community Edition, for free, with the following Modules:

- ABS ContactSight. (CRM)
- ABS Content Portals (CMS)
- ABS Accounting. (AMS)
- ABS Social Networks. (Intranet Social Network)
- ABS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- Infinity Comex (eCommerce Engine)

## How to get started?
To get started, you will need to create an Alliance ID account. Now, you may think... 🙄 another account? But don't worry. Creating your Alliance ID Account is (and will always be) free, takes just a few seconds and you don't even need a password (unless you wanna have one). This account will give you instant access to everything else at Fenix Alliance Group.

A note about your account and the privacy of your information.
The Alliance ID Accounts engine - Alliance Passport Services - is built on top of a highly compliant service to keep your identity private. This engine supports Facebook, Microsoft Accounts, Google+, LinkedIn, and many other identity providers, or you can integrate your own.

We think that it's also worth pointing out that we DO NOT store any identity information into our databases; instead, that data is always encrypted and sent to the same systems that governments and enterprises worldwide are using to keep your data safe, and then we access that data by using industry-standard protocols so that you can rest assured that your sensitive information is protected through various security controls in addition to multi-factor authentication.

# Getting Started

** Using Version 1.*.*

- Install **[.NET 5 SDK (v5.0.100)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)**.
   
- Install the latest edition (v16.8 or higher) of [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (Community, Professional, or Enterprise Editions) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload enabled. Alliance Business Suite works with ALL editions of Visual Studio from Community to Enterprise. If you do not have a SQL Server installation available already and you wish to use LocalDB for development, you must also install the **.NET desktop development workload**.  

- Download a release or Clone the ABS. Portal repository to your local system using Git. Open the **FenixAlliance.ABS.Portal.sln** solution file and Build the solution. Make sure you specify FenixAlliance.ABS.Portal as the Startup Project and then Run the application.


**Installing an official release:**

- A detailed set of instructions for installing Alliance Business Suite on IIS is located here: [Installing Alliance Business Suite on IIS](https://absuite.net/blog/installing-abs-on-iis)
- Instructions for upgrading Alliance Business Suite are located here: [Upgrading Alliance Business Suite ](https://absuite.net/blog/upgrading-abs)

**Additional Instructions**

- If you have already installed a previous version of Alliance Business Suite and you wish to do a clean database install, simply point the DefaultConnection value in the ABS Portal Settings Manager to a fresh database record. This will trigger a re-install when you run the application which will execute the database installation scripts.
   
- Every ABS Repo ignores appsettings.json by default, so as long as you don't delete the directive from .gitignore, you're cleared to submit a pull request. 

**Video Series**

- If you are getting started with Alliance Business Suite, a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGYfOT42OgSZdmYctCWeiRkPfGVQbCRWM) are available which explain how to install the product, interact with the user interface, and develop custom modules.

# Release Announcements

[Alliance Business Suite v1.2.5](https://absuite.net/Blog/announcing-1-25-for-net-5)

# Example Screenshots

## APS IAM Social Providers:
Alliance Passport Services provides Internal, B2B, and B2C identity as a service. It allows users to use their preferred social, enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on access to the Alliance Business Suite.

Alliance Passport Services (APS) is Fenix Alliance's cloud-based identity and access management service, which helps your customers and employees to sign in and access resources in your deployment, such as apps on your tenant, portal instances, Infinity Comex Deployments, along with any cloud apps developed by your own organization.

# Versioning

Maintaining forward and backward compatibility is a key goal of the ABS. Therefore, the ABS now uses only additive versioning, which means any revision of the ABM following the "2.0" release will not:

* Introduce new mandatory attributes on previously published entities, or change an optional attribute to be mandatory
* Rename previously published attributes or entities
* Remove previously published attributes
