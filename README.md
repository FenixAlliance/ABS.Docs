# Welcome to the Alliance Business Suite Documentation!

The Alliance Business Suite is being built to aughment businesses across industries all over the world through a low-code, extensible, and fully customizable business development platform.

At a very high level, the Alliance Business Suite is a set of intelligent, extensible, multi-tenant applications built to enable users to jumpstart their business through the acceleration of several core aspects of any given business across industries and countries.

The Alliance Business Suite gives users a Modular, Full-Stack, Low-Code Application Framework built on top of the [Alliance Business Platform](https://absuite.net). 

Both client and server code are written in C#, allowing users to extend the product with their own code through Module libraries. It builds upon next-generation technologies such as Blazor, SignalR, Razor Pages, and MVC through .NET, an open-source and cross-platform framework for building web-mobile apps using C#, with or without the use of JavaScript.

The power of the Alliance Business Suite can be leveraged from small personal blogs,  eCommerce platforms, and professional portfolios to the infrastructure of large corporations.


## About the Alliance Creed

We're designed to succeed when you and your business succeed; that's why we're committed to helping as many people as possible to harness their entire potential. By building on top of word-class technologies, we're designing this solution to jumpstart your business without having to worry about any of the complexity and technical aspects. We simply want to help you make your life easier while increasing your odds for success through the right tools and support on the path to digitalization.

The fact is, since our inception, we've steered towards creating a culture designed to reach beyond expectations together by building an organization whose success strategy is to help others to succeed.

### Well then. What do I get?

We are creating our applications in such a form that they deliver as much value to your business and cause as we can. They work primarily as an interface for users to manage their services, products, and cloud resources. But the truth is that isn't limited to just that.

Our applications are being developed to give you access to every functionality that we implement for our business, to power your business and vision as well. This is because if we can add value to our business and gain a competitive advantage through these tools, chances are you can too!

So far, we've created a few extensions and connectors for the Alliance Business Suite, but you can extend it too! Some of these extensions are open source, so feel free to check their code for extension reference.

Connectors are always free and you can find them on your ABS Extensions page, and some of our extensions have free tiers. You will get the Alliance Business Suite Community Edition, for free, with the following Modules:

- ABS Contact Sight. (CRM)
- ABS Media Portals. (CMS)
- ABS Accounting. (AMS)
- ABS Learning. (LMS)
- ABS Social Networks. (Intranet Social Network)
- ABS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- Infinity Comex (eCommerce Engine)

### User Guide
- [Documentation](https://docs.absuite.net)
- [Roadmap](https://dev.azure.com/fenixalliance/ABS.Docs/_workitems/recentlyupdated)

# Getting Started

- Install **[.NET 6 SDK (v6.0.100)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)**.
   
- Install the latest edition (v16.8 or higher) of [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (Community, Professional, or Enterprise Editions) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload enabled. Alliance Business Suite works with ALL editions of Visual Studio from Community to Enterprise. If you do not have a SQL Server installation available already and you wish to use LocalDB for development, you must also install the **.NET desktop development workload**.  

- Download a release or Clone the ABS. Portal repository to your local system using Git. Open the **FenixAlliance.ABS.Portal.sln** solution file and Build the solution. Make sure you specify FenixAlliance.ABS.Portal as the Startup Project and then Run the application.


**Installing an official release:**

- A detailed set of instructions for installing Alliance Business Suite on IIS is located here: [Installing Alliance Business Suite on IIS](https://absuite.net/blog/installing-abs-on-iis)
- Instructions for upgrading Alliance Business Suite are located here: [Upgrading Alliance Business Suite ](https://absuite.net/blog/upgrading-abs)

**Additional Instructions**

- If you have already installed a previous version of Alliance Business Suite and you wish to do a clean database install, simply point the DefaultConnection value in the ABS Portal Settings Manager to a fresh database record. This will trigger a re-install when you run the application which will execute the database installation scripts.
   
- Every ABS Repo ignores appsettings.json by default, so as long as you don't delete the directive from .gitignore, you're cleared to submit a pull request. 

**Video Series**

- If you are getting started with Alliance Business Suite, a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGYfOT42OgSZdmYctCWeiRkPfGVQbCRWM) are available that explain how to install the product, interact with the user interface, and develop custom modules.

## Documentation
There is a separate [Documentation repository](https://dev.azure.com/fenixalliance/ABS.Docs), which contains various types of documentation for the Alliance Business Suite, including the C# API documentation for every class on every library. The contents of the repository are available at [https://docs.absuite.net](https://docs.absuite.net) as interactive documentation.

# Versioning

Maintaining forward and backward compatibility is a key goal of the ABS. Therefore, the ABS now uses only additive versioning, which means any revision of the ABM following the "2.0" release will not:

* Introduce new mandatory attributes on previously published entities, or change an optional attribute to be mandatory
* Rename previously published attributes or entities
* Remove previously published attributes

The brand name Alliance Business Suite and its logos are trademarks of Fenix Alliance S.A.S in Colombia and Fenix Alliance Inc in other countries ("Fenix Alliance").

Fenix Alliance owns and oversees the trademarks for the ABS name and logos. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

- We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the ABS name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve ABS.
- We’d like to make it clear how ABS-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the ABS name and logo.
- We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the ABS name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick, or confuse people who are looking for official ABS resources.
