The Alliance Business Suite is a set of extensible, multi-tenant solutions that enable users to accelerate their business growth core aspects of any given business.

The Alliance Business Suite is a Modular Application Framework. It leverages Blazor, an open-source and cross-platform web UI framework for building single-page apps using .NET and C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

ABS is built on top of the [Alliance Business Platform API](https://fenixalliance.com.co/developer), a full-stack web app framework built with ASP.NET Core & C#.

The Alliance Business Model is a declarative specification and definition of standard entities that represent commonly used concepts and activities across business and productivity applications and is being extended to observational and analytical data as well. ABM provides well-defined, modular, and extensible business entities such as Account, Business Unit, Case, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and Items (Products/Services), as well as interactions with vendors, workers, and customers, such as activities and service level agreements. that serve as the dynamic data layer for the entire Alliance Business Suite.

Anyone can build on and extend ABM definitions to capture additional business-specific configurations.

With ABS Portals, users can create external-facing websites that allow employees, customers, partners and others outside their organizations to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in the Alliance Business Model, or browse content anonymously. 

These capabilities feature a revamped end-to-end experience for makers to quickly create a website and customize it with pages, layout, and content. Developers can reuse page designs through templates, add forms and views to display key data from the Alliance Business Model, and publish to users.

# Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create an Alliance ID account. Now, you may think... 🙄 another account? But don't worry. Creating your Alliance ID Account is (and will always be) free, takes just a few seconds and you don't even need a password (unless you want to have one). This account will give you instant access to everything else at Fenix Alliance Group.

**Additional Instructions**

- If you have already installed a previous version of Alliance Business Suite and you wish to do a clean database install, simply point the DefaultConnection value in the ABS Portal Settings Manager to a fresh database record. This will trigger a re-install when you run the application which will execute the database installation scripts.
   
- Every ABS Repo ignores appsettings.json by default, so as long as you don't delete the directive from .gitignore, you're cleared to submit a pull request.

# Versioning

Maintaining forward and backward compatibility is a key goal of the ABS. Therefore, the ABS uses only additive versioning, which means any revision of the ABM following the "1.0" release will not:

* Introduce new mandatory attributes on previously published entities, or change an optional attribute to be mandatory
* Rename previously published attributes or entities
* Remove previously published attributes
