### APIs

Fenix Alliance exposes a wide set of APIs for interoperability with Online Services. These APIs are divided into Service Endpoint Sets and can be used to create, read, update or delete information from an Online Business Tenant.

#### REST API

By using standard HTTP Requests customers can perform requests to a wide variety of service endpoints designed to follow the Open API Standard. By default, the Platform generates and exposes Swagger JSON in version 3.0 of the specificationâ€”officially called the OpenAPI Specification.

#### GraphQl API
GraphQL was developed by Facebook to facilitate the consultation of information, for example, a mobile application usually contains less information than a web application, so instead of creating 2 services, a service is created to bring only the information that is needed.

The structure of GraphQL is made up of 3 parts
- Operation
- Table and/or data
- Table fields

GraphQL is based on sending requests through queries, there are 3 types:
1. Query: To consult information
1. Mutation: To modify information (create, delete, modify)
1. Subscription: For WebSockets (with WebSockets you can for example receive notifications when an event occurs)
